[{"page_content": "Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre\nThis document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.\nThere is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.\nTo see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the \u201cAdd Books\u201d button and then click \u201cConvert\u201d.  Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click \u201cOK\u201d.\n\nText Formatting\nInline formatting\nHere, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.\nHere is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.\nA paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph \u2014 calibre can handle both with equal ease.\nFun with fonts\nThis document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion. \nParagraph level formatting\nYou can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.\nFor the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.\nTables\nTables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.\nNow let\u2019s look at a fancier table\u2014one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.\n\nNext, we see a table with special formatting in various locations. Notice how the formatting for the header row and sub header rows is preserved.\nSource: Fictitious data, for illustration purposes only\nNext, we have something a little more complex, a nested table, i.e. a table inside another table. Additionally, the inner table has some of its cells merged. The table is displayed horizontally centered.", "metadata": {}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "We end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don\u2019t fare well in ebooks.\nStructural Elements\nMiscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. \nFootnotes & Endnotes\nFootnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.\nDropcaps\nD\nrop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a \u201cD\u201d dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\nLinks\nTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\nTable of Contents\nThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.\nIf no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \nDemonstration of DOCX support in calibre\t1\nText Formatting\t2\nInline formatting\t2\nFun with fonts\t2\nParagraph level formatting\t2\nTables\t3\nStructural Elements\t5\nFootnotes & Endnotes\t5\nDropcaps\t5\nLinks\t5\nTable of Contents\t5\nImages\t7\nLists\t8\nBulleted List\t8\nNumbered List\t8\nMulti-level Lists\t8\nContinued Lists\t8", "metadata": {}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Images\nImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that \u201cfloats \u201c on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\nThe final type of image is a \u201cblock\u201d image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\nCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\nLists\nAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\nBulleted List\nOne\nTwo\nNumbered List\nOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\nTwo\nMulti-level Lists\nOne\nTwo\nThree\nFour with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly.\nFive\nSix\nA Multi-level list with bullets:\nOne\nTwo\nThis bullet uses an image as the bullet item\nFour\nFive\nContinued Lists\nOne\nTwo\nAn interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant public service announcement.\nWe now resume our normal programming\nFour", "metadata": {}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "Table of\nContents\nI.

Most of us have never actually learned the design\nprinciples necessary to impact audiences through visual storytelling. Perhaps the\nclosest we have ever come to crafting a visual message is a PowerPoint\npresentation full of bullet points, overused stock photos and bland color schemes. \nBut these kinds of presentations rarely inspire real change, especially in this new\nage of visual communication.  \nA good public speaker with a boring slide deck may be able to maintain the\nattention of an audience for a few minutes, but a good public speaker with a well-\nplanned and well-designed visual presentation can truly mesmerize an audience. \nIn this book, we\u2019ll cover basic design principles and tools you can apply right away\nto take your slide decks from mediocre to stunning. \nVisual Slides for a Visual Age \u00a0|\u00a0 04", "metadata": {}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "In this book, we\u2019ll cover basic design principles and tools you can apply right away\nto take your slide decks from mediocre to stunning. \nVisual Slides for a Visual Age \u00a0|\u00a0 04\nMy best advice is to not start in PowerPoint.\nPresentation tools force you to think through information\nlinearly, and you really need to start by thinking of the\nwhole instead of the individual lines.\nNancy Duarte\nA New Way to Think\nAbout Presentations \nFor most people, using presentation software to create slide decks\nhas become second nature: You simply choose a design template,\ninsert your text, create bullet points for each slide, add a few images\nhere and there\u2014and voil\u00e0! You\u2019re done\u2014right?  \nNot if you really want to impress your audience. \nThe most effective speakers have learned to wean themselves off\nbullet-ridden slides in favor of highly visual presentations that\nreinforce their words\u2014instead of repeating them. \nThis comes to no surprise since human beings are hardwired to\nprocess images quicker than textual information\u2014as fast as 13\nmilliseconds, according to one of the latest studies. \nSadly, however, most students, academics and business people are\ntaught to stick to the old way of creating presentations: full of text-\nheavy slides that make it harder\u2014not easier\u2014to understand and act\nupon your message. \nA New Way to Think About Presentations \u2022 Say It Visually\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 06\nSay It Visually\nare visual\nlearners\n65%\n30%\n5%\nSource\nTypes of Learners in the General Population \nare auditory\nlearners\nare experiential\nlearners\nEach day, more than 35 million PowerPoint presentations are created\u2014and\nmillions more hours are spent delivering them before audiences across the globe. \nFrom boardrooms to classrooms, people are gathering at this very moment to\nlisten to the presenter before them and decide whether to act upon the message\nthey\u2019re receiving or reject it. \nThe fate of companies, students\u2019 career choices, or important life decisions may\nvery well be in\ufb02uenced by the visual thinking\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with which a\ncertain slide deck was created. \nIt is inevitable, then, that presentations will become more and more visual with\ntime. Instead of static slides, we will start to see increasingly dynamic ones that\nintegrate seamlessly with the live delivery of information. \nVideo, sound, text, images and spoken words will all come together harmoniously\nin service of the presenter\u2019s mission to deliver a message in the most impactful\nmanner possible. \nA New Way to Think About Presentations \u2022 The Future of Presentations\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 07\nThe Future\nof\u00a0Presentations\nVideo, sound, text, images and spoken\nwords will all come together seamlessly to\ndeliver a message in the most impactful\nmanner possible.\nDoes this mean that visuals will trump the written word? By no means!\nWhether you\u2019re dealing with a multimedia presentation, a Hollywood movie\nor a novel, one thing will always reign supreme: the power of storytelling. \nThis is why well-designed slides will always start with a good story and good\ncontent\u2014not the other way around. \nSo, the three essential ingredients to a successful presentation are: the\ncontent, the design and the delivery. We will cover each of these\ncomponents, one by one, in this book. \nA New Way to Think About Presentations \u2022 The Ingredients of a Successful Presentation\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 08\nThe Three Legs of\u00a0a\nGood Presentation\nDelivery\nContent\nVisual Design\nYou have to make the audience care.\nPresentations in all their many forms are never\njust about transferring information alone.\nGarr Reynolds\nSource\nWhat Is Your Message? \nWe all learned in high school or college that a piece of communication can have one of\nfour purposes: to inform, entertain, inspire or persuade. \nThese same communicational objectives can be applied to presentation giving. For\nexample, within a business setting, your goal may be to accomplish more than one of\nthese objectives: to inform your audience and also inspire them to take action.", "metadata": {}, "type": "Document"}, {"page_content": "example, within a business setting, your goal may be to accomplish more than one of\nthese objectives: to inform your audience and also inspire them to take action. \nIn this case, you may want to use a combination of storytelling techniques and the\nexposition of facts to get your point across.\nIn her book Resonate, presentation guru Nancy Duarte proposes a way to weave both\nWhat Is Your Message? \u2022 Facts and Stories\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 10\nFacts and Stories\n\u00a0of these into your narrative. She proposes thinking about presentations as\nsomewhere between two extremes: a report, full of unexciting numbers and \ufb01gures,\nand a story, which has the power to keep viewers at the edge of their seats. While\nfacts are used to inform, stories create memorable experiences. \nBy shifting between facts that provide a snapshot of the current reality and stories\nthat paint a picture of the ideal situation, you create suspense and desire in your\naudience to learn what comes next. Duarte visualizes this alternating between facts\nand stories as a sparkline, which represents the dramatic tension created by\ncomparing what is with what could be. \nWhat could be\nWhat could be\nWhat could be\nWhat is\nWhat is\nWhat is\nWhat is\nThe\u00a0gap\nReward: New bliss\nBEGINNING\nPaint a picture of the\nrealities of the audience's\ncurrent world.\nMIDDLE\nPresent contrasting content, alternating\nbetween what is and what could be.\nEND\nEnd the presentation on a\nhigher plane than it began,\nwith everyone understanding\nthe reward in the future.\nCROSS THE THRESHOLD\nThe audience commits to\ntaking action, knowing it\nwon't be easy but will be\nworth the reward.\nTurning\npoint 1\nCALL TO ADVENTURE\nCreate an imbalance by\nstating what could be\njuxtaposed\u00a0to what is.\nTurning\npoint 2\nCALL TO ACTION\nArticulate the \ufb01nish line\nthe audience is to cross.\nNow that you\u2019ve de\ufb01ned the objective of your presentation\u2014whether to\ninform, entertain, persuade, inspire, or a combination of all of these\u2014you can\nnow start the brainstorming process. \nAlthough you\u2019ve probably made the mistake of opening up PowerPoint and\ncreating your slides without any forethought, the best presentations are the\nproduct of careful planning and purposeful brainstorming. \nStart by taking a piece of paper and pencil and drawing out your ideas; this\u00a0\nwill help get your creative juices \ufb02owing and allow you to generate ideas freely,\nwithout the sense of \ufb01nality that comes with inserting content onto a slide. \nYou can use diagrams such as mind maps, Venn diagrams, tree diagrams, and\nspoke diagrams to illustrate your initial ideas.\nWhat Is Your Message? \u2022 How to Brainstorm\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 11\nHow to brainstorm\nYou can also use abstract diagrams or visual analogies to de\ufb01ne a visual theme\nthat will tie your presentation together.

Our gaze then moves to\nthe rest of the text, and \ufb01nally to the\nelements in the background.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USE CONTRAST TO\n\u00a0ATTRACT VIEWERS\u2019 EYES\n3\nSource\nHow to Create Visual Hierarchy \u2022 Use Contrast to Attract Viewers\u2019 Eyes\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 95\nIn this slide deck, we see the\nsame effect.

Now, we will go over how\nyou can use alignment to do the same.\nAlignment is part of the structure by which\nelements are placed in a design. It dictates\nthat visual components, whether they be text\nor images, are not positioned arbitrarily\nthroughout a composition. For example, a\ntypical page of text is aligned to the left, so\nthat objects share a left margin.\nSimple visual designs most frequently align in\nthe center of the frame, a format that\nprovides balance and harmony. But not all\ndesigns have to be perfectly symmetrical to\nbe aesthetically pleasing.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USE\u00a0ALIGNMENT TO\nDIRECT THE EYES.\n4\nSource\nHow to Create Visual Hierarchy \u2022 Use Alignment to Direct the Eyes\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 97\nTake a look at how this slide draws\nviewers\u2019 attention \ufb01rst to the\nwoman and then to the left-aligned\ntext, and then back to the woman.\nThe left-aligned text helps to\nbalance the design, which is visually\nheavy on the right side.\n\u00a0 \nMost Western readers are\naccustomed to reading from the left\nto the right side of a page.\nTherefore, designs featuring text\nare often aligned to the left margin\nin the same fashion.\nHERE TODAY?\nSo, what brings you\nHow to Create Visual Hierarchy \u2022 Use Alignment to Direct the Eyes\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 98\nBut right alignments are also\nemployed to provide balance to a\ndesign that may be more visually\nheavy on the left side.\nHERE TODAY?\nSo, what brings you\nHow to Create Visual Hierarchy \u2022 Use the Rule of Thirds to Create a Focal Point\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0 99\nArtists, photographers and graphic designers have\nlong employed the rule of thirds to improve the\noverall balance of their compositions.

It has many\nfunctions within a visual: It lets the readers\u2019 eyes\nrest; it gives room for visual pathways that the eye\ncan follow; it draws attention to the main elements\nof your design; and it makes your design look clean,\nsophisticated and ef\ufb01cient.\nTake a look at how the use of negative space\nemphasizes the key elements in these slides.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USE NEGATIVE SPACE TO\nEMPHASIZE KEY ELEMENTS.\n6\nSource\nSource\nSource\nSource\nAnother characteristic of an effective design is\nthat the individual elements that make it up are\nbarely noticeable. Instead, what comes across\nloud and clear is the key message, communicated\nthrough words as well as dozens of small but\ndeliberate design decisions.\n\u00a0\nHere are a few principles you can apply to make\nyour designs more coherent and harmonious.\nPutting It All Together \u2022 How to Create a Coherent Design\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0101\nThe whole is greater than\nthe sum of its parts.\nHow to Create\na Coherent\nDesign\nAristotle\nHow to Create a Coherent Design\u00a0\u2022 Create Associations Between Elements\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0102\nYou can easily tie the elements of a design\ntogether by making them similar. For example,\nif you have a slide with three different types of\nelements, you can visually relate them by using\nthe same color for each type. Even if elements\nof the same color are not close to each other\non the slide, viewers will unconsciously group\nthem together.\n\u00a0 \nFor example, look at how the use of orange in\nthe \ufb01rst slide at the top creates an association\nbetween the word \"pretender\" and half of the\nhuman \ufb01gure. Or how the use of the color\nwhite in the slide next to it differentiates a\nseries of circles from those below. In the two\nslides in the second row, the use of the color\nred creates an instant association between the\nkey words and their graphical counterparts.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CREATE ASSOCIATIONS\nBETWEEN ELEMENTS.\n1\nSource\nSource\nHow to Create a Coherent Design\u00a0\u2022 Suggest a Visual Connection Through Closure\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0103\nAnother mark of a good slide design is the\nef\ufb01cient use of space. In order to eliminate\nunnecessary details, designers often apply\nthe Gestalt principle of closure, which is an\neffect that allows us to see complete \ufb01gures\neven when some information is missing.\n\u00a0 \nTake, for example, this slide design.\nAlthough we can only see part of an image,\nthe viewer automatically \ufb01lls in the rest of\nthe details to create a complete picture\n\u00a0 \nSo, instead of trying to \ufb01t complete pictures\nof objects into your slides, simply display\nenough of it to conjure up the right mental\nimage in your viewers\u2019 minds.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 SUGGEST A VISUAL\nCONNECTION THROUGH\nCLOSURE.\n2\nAll information provided\nToo much information missing\nJust enough information\nHow to Create a Coherent Design\u00a0\u2022 Use Repeated Elements to Tie Your Design Together\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0104\nAnother way to achieve a cohesive\ndesign is to repeat certain elements.\nThis way, the viewer recognizes a visual\npattern and knows what to expect next.\n\u00a0 \nIn this presentation design, for\nexample, the same border style is seen\non several slides, along with the same\ncolor overlays and style of icons.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 USE REPEATED\nELEMENTS TO TIE YOUR\nDESIGN TOGETHER.\n3\nSource\nHow to Create a Coherent Design\u00a0\u2022 Suggest a Visual Connection Through Closure\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0105\nThis doesn\u2019t mean, however, that a\ndecorative element such as a shape\nmust appear in the same color and\nthe same exact position on each\nslide.

Besides static objects that suddenly go into motion, the\nappearance of \u201cnew objects among a background of old objects\u201d also\ncaptures viewers\u2019 attention.\n\u00a0 \nYou can take this \ufb01nding into consideration when creating slide builds,\nwhich allow you to convey complex information by bringing in bits of\ninformation, piece by piece.\nPutting It All Together \u2022 How to Use Transitions and Animation Effects\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0107\nDesign is, literally, purposeful planning.
